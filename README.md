### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis, and some other Private stuff
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more javascript, and c#
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source project
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can't!

Well there isn't much to say I'm your average open source hobby developer, who wants to be a real developer someday.

Although my interests change all the time, I have always come back to development. Because no matter what I enjoy at the time, I can always develop something for that topic!

My Pfp will probally change alot, but my username will most likely never!
